| v1.0.0rc4 | 2016-12-16 | Yet another rename! |

This time to the final, Adobe-approved name, which ironically doesn't have Adobe in it!

So now we are at rc4, and I expect this will become 1.0.0 later today!  Fingers crossed!! üëç

| v1.0.0rc3 | 2016-12-14 | Copyrights added. |

Fixes #4, which was the only blocker for release.  Putting out what is hopefully the final candidate.

This also brands the adobe.io short link in the setup.py description of the module.

| v1.0.0rc2 | 2016-12-14 | rename complete - next release candidate |

This is expected to be the final release, barring any bugs found in final testing.  The naming has been updated, and the build is [posted on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/adobe-umapi-client/1.0.0rc2/).

| v1.0.0rc1 | 2016-12-13 | everything done but the naming |

This was going to be the content of the first release, but then we decided to name the published object differently.  This one is functionally complete, has full smoke-testing, and runs on Python 2.7.x and 3.5.x.
