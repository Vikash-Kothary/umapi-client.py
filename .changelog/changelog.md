title: rename complete - next release candidate

This is expected to be the final release, barring any bugs found in final testing.  The naming has been updated, and the build is [posted on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/adobe-umapi-client/1.0.0rc2/).

tag: v1.0.0rc1

title: everything done but the naming
---

This was going to be the content of the first release, but then we decided to name the published object differently.  This one is functionally complete, has full smoke-testing, and runs on Python 2.7.x and 3.5.x.
