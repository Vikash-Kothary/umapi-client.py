| v2.6 | 2017-08-05 | Unicode fixes |

This is a bug fix release aimed at fixing error messages related to invalid Unicode input.  Without these fixes, clients cannot handle the error strings being returned.  (See #50 for details.)

| v2.5.2 | 2017-06-16 | minor enhancement to v2.5.1 |

This release reads the wall clock to return an accurate "total time" in the `UnavailableError` (and associated logging).  It's an improvement to the fix of #47, but it has no separate issue.

| v2.5 | 2017-05-10 | allow control of group membership info returned by UsersQuery |

The results of UsersQuery include group memberships for all returned users.  The server API includes a query flag that controls whether this membership information includes only direct memberships, or also includes indirect memberships in product configurations that contain user groups that contain the user.  But umapi-client was not exposing control over this flag.  This release exposes the server's _directOnly_ query parameter as direct_only boolean flag to the UsersQuery initializer.  The default value of the flag is `True`, meaning only include direct memberships in the returned data.

| v2.4.1 | 2017-05-04 | Fast follow bug fix for v2.4 validation issues |

This tightens up the validation of Unicode emails and usernames introduced in v2.4 so it matches the validation performed by Adobe's UMAPI server.  It also fixes a cosmetic issue with validation error messages.  See issue #42 for details.

| v2.3 | 2017-04-17 | Security enhancement release |

This release adds the ability for clients to specify their private key data directly when creating a connection, as opposed to having to put it in a local file.  Thus it allows removing the chance of someone else on the machine observing the file content.  For details, see the documentation of `Connection.__init__`, in particular the new `private_key_data` argument.

This release also adds certification for Python 2.6 support.

| v2.2 | 2017-03-29 | Error handling for user sync |

This release adds better error handling during processing of actions in batches: when the server response is not understood, the client doesn't throw except at the end of the batch, and the error thrown contains the usual return statistics from the batch processing.

| v2.1 | 2017-03-24 | v2.1 - match evolution of the server API |

This is a very small release, but necessary to match evolution of the server API around removing users from organizations and deleting their user accounts. It's numbered 2.1 rather than 2.0.4 so the name looks cleaner in a requirements file for clients who are seeing the new server behavior.

| v2.0b2 | 2016-12-27 | Release beta 2 |

With better legacy support and a brand new documentation wiki,
we are getting close to a release candidate for v2.  There's a bit
more work to do on the v2 usage docs first.

OMG!  That has to be the shortest-lived 1.0 release ever!

This pushes the fix of #12 to PyPI.  I have also removed the older postings.

This time to the final, Adobe-approved name, which ironically doesn't have Adobe in it!

So now we are at rc4, and I expect this will become 1.0.0 later today!  Fingers crossed!! üëç

This is expected to be the final release, barring any bugs found in final testing.  The naming has been updated, and the build is [posted on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/adobe-umapi-client/1.0.0rc2/).

| v1.0.0rc1 | 2016-12-13 | everything done but the naming |

This was going to be the content of the first release, but then we decided to name the published object differently.  This one is functionally complete, has full smoke-testing, and runs on Python 2.7.x and 3.5.x.
